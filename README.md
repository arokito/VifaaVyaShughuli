This is a customized web based application built for a particular client who owns a business of renting functional items and wishes to have an online system that enables this bussiness to be accessed anywhere at anytime. The client/system admin has control over the system in a way that he/she can upload item images and provide their descriptions including price, color, weight and others. The system enables customers to  only view the available items in the system such as tables, chairs, decorations, dishes, tents and others, but to place an order, the system requires only a registered customer to do so. The system also enables customers to make online payments through the use of control numbers. In addition, the customer can view related invoices.
